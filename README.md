Welcome to my personal GitHub page, where I'd like to create, manage and self-learning many interesting Machine Learning & Deep Learning projects.
<br/>
Something about me:
- 👨‍💻 My nickname is HGanyu (which was formed when I was young 😁)
- 🏫 I'm currently learning at FPT High School Da Nang
- 💻 I'm actively working as a Data Science learner, with a bit lack of experiences
- 🇻🇳 I'm a native speaker and living in Vietnam, but I can understand and response with my intermidiate English skill
